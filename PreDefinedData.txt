# ListOfSeedData.js - Predefined Data Configuration

## Overview
The `ListOfSeedData.js` file contains all predefined data structures and constants that are seeded into the database during application initialization. This file serves as the central configuration for all static data required by the transport management system.

## Purpose
This file defines:
- User roles and their hierarchy
- User status definitions and workflow states
- Vehicle types and status classifications
- Document types and requirements
- Journey status lifecycle management
- Payment methods and statuses
- Subscription plans and pricing
- Commission rates and financial configurations
- Cancellation reasons and delinquency types

## Key Data Structures

### 1. User Roles (`roleList`)
Defines the complete user hierarchy in the system:
- **Passenger (ID: 1)**: Users who create transport requests
- **Driver (ID: 2)**: Users who accept and fulfill transport requests
- **Admin (ID: 3)**: System administrators with management privileges
- **Vehicle Owner (ID: 4)**: Owners of vehicles in the system
- **System (ID: 5)**: Automated system processes
- **Super Admin (ID: 6)**: Highest level administrators
- **Unknown Role (ID: 7)**: Default role for new registrations

### 2. User Status (`statusList`)
Manages user account states with priority-based evaluation:
- **Active (ID: 1)**: Fully operational users
- **Inactive - Vehicle Not Registered (ID: 2)**: Drivers without registered vehicles
- **Inactive - Required Documents Missing (ID: 3)**: Missing mandatory documentation
- **Inactive - Documents Rejected (ID: 4)**: Rejected documentation
- **Inactive - Documents Pending (ID: 5)**: Awaiting document approval
- **Inactive - User Banned (ID: 6)**: Admin-banned users
- **Inactive - No Subscription (ID: 7)**: Drivers without active subscriptions

### 3. Journey Status (`journeyStatus`)
Complete journey lifecycle management (15 states):
- **Waiting (1)**: Initial request state
- **Requested (2)**: Request sent to driver
- **Accepted by Driver (3)**: Driver accepts with bid
- **Accepted by Passenger (4)**: Passenger selects driver
- **Journey Started (5)**: Transportation begins
- **Journey Completed (6)**: Journey finished successfully
- **Cancelled States (7-12)**: Various cancellation scenarios
- **System States (13-15)**: Automated processing states

### 4. Document Types (`listOfDocuments`)
Required documentation for user verification:
- **Driver's License**: Mandatory with expiration
- **Vehicle Registration**: Proof of vehicle ownership
- **Insurance Document**: Coverage verification
- **Profile Photo**: User identification
- **Tax ID**: Tax registration verification
- **Vehicle Use Delegation**: Permission documentation
- **National ID**: Identity verification

### 5. Vehicle Types (`vehicleTypes`)
Supported vehicle classifications with capacity:
- **Isuzu FSR**: 100 quintal capacity
- **Isuzu NPR**: 50 quintal capacity
- **Euro Tracker**: 430 quintal capacity
- **Sino Truck**: 150 quintal capacity

### 6. Payment Configuration
- **Payment Methods**: Cash, Bank Transfer, Telebirr
- **Payment Status**: Pending, Completed, Failed
- **Commission Rates**: 10% standard commission
- **Financial Accounts**: Bank and mobile money configurations

### 7. Subscription Management
- **Plan Types**: Free (1 month), Paid (1, 3, 12 months)
- **Pricing**: 700 (30 days), 1800 (90 days), 6000 (365 days)
- **Deposit Sources**: Driver transfers, admin deposits, bonuses

### 8. Quality Management
- **Delinquency Types**: Driver/passenger behavior tracking
- **Cancellation Reasons**: Role-specific cancellation justifications
- **Commission Status**: REQUESTED, PENDING, PAID, FREE, CANCELED

## Technical Implementation

### Constants and Mappings
The file provides numerous constants for type-safe operations:
- `USER_STATUS`: Numeric status constants
- `journeyStatusMap`: Name-to-ID mappings
- `activeJourneyStatuses`: Active journey state list
- `usersRoles`: Role ID constants

### Data Relationships
- Document requirements linked to roles via `driversDocumentRequirement`
- Journey status transitions follow predefined workflows
- User status evaluation follows priority hierarchy
- Subscription plans linked to pricing configurations

## Usage in Application
This data is automatically seeded during database initialization via the `installPreDefinedData` endpoint. All subsequent operations reference these predefined values to ensure data consistency and system integrity.

## Maintenance
When updating this file:
1. Maintain existing ID assignments to prevent data corruption
2. Update related mappings and constants
3. Consider database migration implications
4. Test all dependent functionality
5. Update documentation accordingly

This file serves as the foundation for all business logic and data validation throughout the transport management system.
