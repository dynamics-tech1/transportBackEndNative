/**
 * Passenger Create Request Endpoint
 *
 * Purpose: Creates a new journey/shipping request for a passenger/shipper. This endpoint enables
 * passengers to request transportation services for their goods, allowing drivers to find and
 * bid on available journeys. The endpoint supports batch requests (multiple   Vehicle for one batch)
 * and prevents duplicate requests using passengerRequestBatchId grouping.
 *
 * Context & Use Case:
 * - Passenger/shipper wants to transport goods from origin to destination
 * - Passenger may need multiple   Vehicle for a single batch of requests (e.g., large shipment)
 * - Request is grouped by passengerRequestBatchId to prevent duplicate creation
 * - After creation, request is available for drivers to find and bid on
 * - System automatically finds nearby drivers and sends notifications
 * - Admin can create requests on behalf of shippers (requires phone number)
 * - Driver can create request when picking up goods from street (takes from street scenario)
 *
 * When to Use:
 * - Passenger wants to request transportation for goods
 * - Passenger needs multiple   Vehicle (numberOfVehicles > 1)
 * - Admin wants to create request for shipper (requires shipperPhoneNumber)
 * - Driver picks up goods from street and needs to create request (driver "take from street" scenario)
 * - Request is for shipping cargo/goods (not passenger transport)
 *
 * How it works:
 * 1. Validates required fields (passengerRequestBatchId, destination, vehicle, originLocation, etc.)
 * 2. Extracts userUniqueId from authentication token (for passengers) or creates user (for admin)
 * 3. If admin: Creates passenger user account within same transaction as request creation (atomic)
 * 4. Wraps admin user creation (if needed) + batch check + request creation in transaction (atomic operation)
 * 5. Checks existing requests by passengerRequestBatchId + userUniqueId
 * 6. Validates not all requests already created (existingRequestsCount < numberOfVehicles)
 * 7. Creates remaining requests sequentially (numberOfVehicles - existingRequestsCount)
 * 8. Each request is created with journeyStatusId = waiting (1)
 * 9. Returns all newly created requests with success message

 *
 * Database Operations:
 * 1. ✅ WRITE (Admin only - SAME TRANSACTION): Creates passenger user account
 *    - If shipperRequestCreatedByRoleId ===adminRoleId: Creates Users record
 *    - ✅ FIXED: Uses createUser function with connection parameter (same transaction)
 *    - Creates Users record with:
 *      - userUniqueId (UUID)
 *      - phoneNumber (from shipperPhoneNumber)
 *      - email (fake email with random number)
 *      - roleId = passengerRoleId (1)
 *      - statusId = ACTIVE (1)
 *      - fullName = null
 *    - Also creates usersCredential record (within same transaction)
 *    - ✅ FIXED: Uses same connection/transaction as request creation (full transaction support)
 *    - If user already exists (same phone), returns existing user
 *
 * 2. ✅ READ (within transaction): Checks existing requests by batchId
 *    - Uses connection query if provided (transaction support)
 *    - SELECT * FROM PassengerRequest WHERE passengerRequestBatchId = ? AND userUniqueId = ?
 *    - Counts existing requests for this batch
 *    - Used to prevent exceeding numberOfVehicles limit
 *
 * 3. ✅ READ (outside transaction, before request creation): Validates vehicle type
 *    - For each request creation: SELECT * FROM VehicleTypes WHERE vehicleTypeUniqueId = ?
 *    - Validates vehicle type exists before creating request
 *    - Returns error if vehicle type not found
 *
 * 4. ✅ WRITE (within transaction): Creates PassengerRequest records
 *    - For each remaining request: INSERT INTO PassengerRequest
 *    - Creates records sequentially (loop: 0 to noOfRecords)
 *    - Each record includes:
 *      - passengerRequestUniqueId (UUID, auto-generated)
 *      - userUniqueId (from token or newly created admin user)
 *      - vehicleTypeUniqueId (from request body)
 *      - originLatitude, originLongitude, originPlace (from originLocation)
 *      - destinationLatitude, destinationLongitude, destinationPlace (from destination.description || null)
 *      - journeyStatusId = waiting (1) - initial status
 *      - shippableItemName, shippableItemQtyInQuintal
 *      - shippingDate, deliveryDate, shippingCost
 *      - passengerRequestBatchId (groups related requests)
 *      - shipperRequestCreatedBy, shipperRequestCreatedByRoleId (audit fields)
 *      - shipperRequestCreatedAt (current timestamp)
 *    - All inserts use same connection (within transaction)
 *    - All succeed or all fail (atomic)
 *
 * Transaction Coverage:
 * - ✅ Admin user creation: Fully wrapped in transaction (FIXED)
 *   - createUser function now accepts connection parameter for transaction support
 *   - Admin user creation happens INSIDE the same transaction as request creation
 *   - All operations (user creation, batch check, request creation) are atomic
 *   - ✅ FIXED: No more orphaned users - if request creation fails, user creation is rolled back
 *   - ✅ FIXED: Full transaction support - all succeed or all fail
 *   - Impact: High (prevents data inconsistency - was a critical issue)
 *
 * - ✅ Batch check + request creation: Fully wrapped in transaction
 *   - Batch check (SELECT) uses transaction connection
 *   - All request creations (INSERT) use transaction connection
 *   - All operations atomic (30 second timeout - includes admin user creation if needed)
 *   - Either all requests created or none created (prevents partial creation)
 *   - Automatic rollback on any failure
 *   - Prevents race condition where multiple concurrent requests create more than numberOfVehicles
 *
 * - ✅ Vehicle type validation: Inside transaction (read-only, but uses transaction connection)
 *   - Happens within request creation (before each insert)
 *   - Uses transaction connection for consistent snapshot
 *   - If validation fails, transaction is rolled back (atomic)
 *   - Prevents race condition: Vehicle type deleted between validation and insert
 *
 * Race Condition Prevention:
 * - ✅ Batch check and request creation are atomic (same transaction)
 *   - Prevents time-of-check-time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition
 *   - Multiple concurrent requests with same batchId are serialized by transaction
 *   - First request to acquire lock passes batch check and creates requests
 *   - Subsequent requests see updated count and are rejected or create remaining requests
 *   - Database isolation level ensures consistent snapshot during transaction
 *

 *   ]
 *
 * Response (Success - Driver Creates Request - internal use):
 * - Returns array of request objects directly (no wrapper)
 *   - Used when driver creates request internally (e.g., takeFromStreet)
 *
 * Response (Error):

 * - error: "Vehicle type not found" (if vehicleTypeUniqueId validation fails)
 * - error: "Unable to create request" (general processing error)
 *
 * Security:
 * - Requires valid authentication token (verifyTokenOfAxios)
 * - Validates user has passenger role (roleId ===1) or admin role
 * - For passengers: userUniqueId extracted from token (cannot be spoofed)
 * - For admin: Creates passenger user account within same transaction as request creation (atomic)
 * - Only allows passengers to create requests for themselves (or admin for others)
 *
 * Authorization:
 * - Passengers (roleId ===1) can create requests for themselves
 * - Admin can create requests on behalf of shippers (requires shipperPhoneNumber)
 * - Admin must provide shipperPhoneNumber to create user account
 * - Driver role (roleId ===2) can create requests internally (special use case - takeFromStreet)
 *
 * Validation:
 * - Validates required fields in controller (before service call):
 *   - passengerRequestBatchId, destination, vehicle, originLocation, numberOfVehicles,
 *     shippingDate, shippingCost, shippableItemQtyInQuintal, shippableItemName, deliveryDate
 * - Validates request body format via Joi schema (createPassengerRequest)
 *   - passengerRequestBatchId: UUID format, required
 *   - numberOfVehicles: integer, min: 1, default: 1
 *   - shippingDate, deliveryDate: ISO date format, required
 *   - shippingCost: number, required
 *   - shippableItemQtyInQuintal: number, required
 *   - shippableItemName: string, required
 *   - originLocation: object with latitude, longitude, description (all required)
 *   - destination: object with latitude, longitude, description (latitude/longitude optional, description optional)
 *   - vehicle: object with vehicleTypeUniqueId (UUID, required)
 *   - shipperPhoneNumber: string, optional (required only for admin)
 *   - requestType: "PASSENGER" | "CARGO", optional
 * - Validates passengerRequestBatchId is not null (service level)
 * - Validates userUniqueId is available (after admin user creation if applicable)
 * - Validates vehicle type exists in VehicleTypes table (for each request creation)
 * - Validates existing requests count < numberOfVehicles (batch limit check)
 *
 * Error Cases:
 * - "Missing required fields to create passenger request": Controller validation failed
 *   - Status: 400 Bad Request
 *   - Cause: One or more required fields missing from request body
 * - "Batch uniqueId Can't be null": passengerRequestBatchId missing
 *   - Status: 400 Bad Request
 *   - Cause: passengerRequestBatchId not provided or null
 * - "shipperPhoneNumber is required when admin creates request for shipper": Admin creating but no phone
 *   - Status: 400 Bad Request
 *   - Cause: Admin role but shipperPhoneNumber not provided
 * - "Failed to create user for shipper": User creation failed for admin
 *   - Status: 500 Internal Server Error
 *   - Cause: createUser returned error (phone already exists with different user, database error, etc.)
 * - "Failed to get userUniqueId from created user": User creation succeeded but no userUniqueId returned
 *   - Status: 500 Internal Server Error
 *   - Cause: createUser returned success but dataOfPassenger.userUniqueId is missing
 * - "All required requests have already been created for this batch": Batch limit exceeded
 *   - Status: 409 Conflict (should be, but currently returns error message)
 *   - Cause: Existing requests count >= numberOfVehicles
 *   - Includes: existingRequestsCount, requestedVehicles, passengerRequestBatchId for debugging
 * - "Invalid vehicle type" or "Vehicle type not found": VehicleTypeUniqueId doesn't exist
 *   - Status: 500 Internal Server Error
 *   - Cause: VehicleTypeUniqueId not found in VehicleTypes table
 * - "Unable to create request": General processing error
 *   - Status: 500 Internal Server Error
 *   - Cause: Database error, network error, or other system error
 *
 * Use Cases:
 * 1. Passenger creates single request: numberOfVehicles = 1 → Creates 1 request → Returns 1 request
 * 2. Passenger creates batch request: numberOfVehicles = 3 → Creates 3 requests → Returns 3 requests
 * 3. Passenger creates partial batch: Existing 1 request, numberOfVehicles = 3 → Creates 2 more → Returns 2 requests
 * 4. Passenger attempts duplicate: numberOfVehicles = 2, existing = 2 → Returns error "already created"
 * 5. Admin creates for shipper: Admin provides phone → Creates user → Creates request → Returns request
 * 6. Driver takes from street: Driver picks up goods → Creates passenger user → Creates request (status = journeyStarted) → Returns array → Creates journey
 *
 * Audit Trail - Who Created the Request:
 * - shipperRequestCreatedBy: userUniqueId of who created the request (passenger/admin/driver)
 * - shipperRequestCreatedByRoleId: roleId of creator (1=passenger, 2=driver, 3=admin)
 * - These fields are stored in PassengerRequest table for tracking and reporting
 * - Service uses shipperRequestCreatedByRoleId to determine return behavior:
 *   - Role 1 (Passenger) or 3 (Admin): Returns verifyPassengerStatus result (status counts)
 *   - Role 2 (Driver): Returns array of requests directly (no status counts needed)
 *
 * Status Flow:
 * 1. Request created → journeyStatusId: waiting (1)
 * 2. System finds nearby drivers → Status: requested (2)
 * 3. Driver accepts → Status: acceptedByDriver (3)
 * 4. Passenger accepts driver → Status: acceptedByPassenger (4)
 * 5. Driver starts journey → Status: journeyStarted (5)
 * 6. Driver completes journey → Status: journeyCompleted (6)
 *
 * Important Logic - Batch Grouping:
 * - All requests with same passengerRequestBatchId are treated as related (same shipment)
 * - Prevents creating more requests than numberOfVehicles for a batch
 * - Useful when passenger needs multiple   Vehicle for large shipment
 * - Each request in batch has unique passengerRequestUniqueId but same passengerRequestBatchId
 * - Batch check counts existing requests: WHERE passengerRequestBatchId = ? AND userUniqueId = ?
 * - If existingRequestsCount >= numberOfVehicles: All requests already created, return error
 * - Otherwise: Create remaining requests (numberOfVehicles - existingRequestsCount)
 *
 * Important Logic - Admin User Creation:
 * - Admin can create requests on behalf of shippers who don't have accounts
 * - Creates passenger user account using shipperPhoneNumber
 * - ✅ FIXED: User creation now uses same transaction as request creation (full transaction support)
 * - If user already exists (same phone), returns existing user (no duplicate)
 * - Generated email: fakeEmail_{randomNumber}@passenger.com
 * - Generated userRoleStatusDescription: "this is shipper "
 * - ✅ FIXED: User creation wrapped in same transaction as request creation
 * - ✅ FIXED: If request creation fails, user creation is rolled back (no orphaned users)
 * - ✅ FIXED: All operations atomic - all succeed or all fail together
 *
 * Important Logic - Driver "Take From Street" Scenario:
 * - Driver picks up goods from street while moving (not pre-booked)
 * - ✅ FIXED: Creates passenger user account INSIDE transaction (in DriverRequest.service.js)
 * - ✅ FIXED: User creation uses same transaction as request creation (full transaction support)
 * - Sets audit fields: shipperRequestCreatedBy = driver.userUniqueId, shipperRequestCreatedByRoleId = driver.roleId (2)
 * - Sets journeyStatusId = journeyStarted (5) - driver already picked up goods, not waiting
 * - Returns array of created requests directly (not wrapped in verifyPassengerStatus)
 * - Used immediately to create journey decision and journey record
 * - Audit trail stored in database to track that driver created this request
 * - Note: This is handled in DriverRequest.service.js
 * - ✅ FIXED: All operations atomic - user creation + passenger request + driver request + journey decision + journey + route points
 * - ✅ FIXED: No more orphaned users - if any operation fails, all are rolled back
 *
 * Important Logic - Sequential Creation:
 * - Requests are created sequentially in a loop (not in parallel)
 * - Reason: Each creation depends on previous one (order matters for batch)
 * - Loop: for (let i = 0; i < noOfRecords; i++)
 * - Each iteration: Creates one PassengerRequest record
 * - All creations use same connection (within transaction)
 * - If any creation fails, all are rolled back (atomic)
 * - Alternative: Could use Promise.all for parallel creation, but sequential is safer for batch ordering
 *
 * Important Logic - Vehicle Type Validation:
 * - Vehicle type is validated for EACH request creation (in loop)
 * - Validation happens BEFORE insert (efficient - fails early)
 * - Uses getData to check VehicleTypes table
 * - Returns error if vehicleTypeUniqueId not found
 * - Note: Could be optimized to validate once before loop (minor optimization)
 *
 * Important Logic - Transaction Scope:
 * - ✅ Admin user creation: INSIDE transaction (FIXED - full transaction support)
 *   - Happens within same transaction as request creation
 *   - Uses transaction connection for atomicity
 *   - ✅ FIXED: If request creation fails, user creation is rolled back (no orphaned users)
 * - Batch check: INSIDE transaction
 *   - Uses transaction connection for consistent snapshot
 *   - Prevents race conditions with concurrent requests
 * - ✅ Vehicle type validation: INSIDE transaction (FIXED - uses transaction connection)
 *   - Happens within request creation (before each insert)
 *   - Uses transaction connection for consistent snapshot
 *   - ✅ FIXED: Prevents race condition - vehicle type deleted between validation and insert
 *   - If validation fails, transaction is rolled back (atomic)
 * - Request creation: INSIDE transaction
 *   - All inserts use transaction connection
 *   - All succeed or all fail (atomic)
 *
 * Important Notes:
 * - This endpoint supports batch requests (multiple   Vehicle for one shipment)
 * - Batch grouping prevents duplicate requests using passengerRequestBatchId
 * - Admin can create requests on behalf of shippers (requires phone number)
 * - ✅ FIXED: Admin user creation now uses same transaction as request creation (full transaction support)
 * - Admin user creation + batch check + request creation are all atomic (wrapped in transaction)
 * - Race condition prevented by transaction isolation
 * - Sequential creation ensures batch ordering
 * - Vehicle type validation happens before request creation
 *
 * Performance Notes:
 * - Admin user creation adds one database transaction (if admin)
 * - Batch check uses indexed query (passengerRequestBatchId + userUniqueId)
 * - Vehicle type validation happens before loop (efficient - fails early)
 * - Request creation is sequential (could be parallelized, but safer sequential)
 * - Transaction timeout: 20 seconds (enough for multiple request creations)
 * - Consider adding composite index: (passengerRequestBatchId, userUniqueId) for faster batch checks
 * - Consider caching vehicle type validation (validate once, reuse result)
 *
 * Differences from Other Endpoints:
 * - Unlike /api/driver/request: This endpoint creates passenger requests, not driver requests
 * - Unlike /api/passenger/acceptDriverRequest: This endpoint creates new requests, doesn't accept drivers
 * - Unlike /api/passenger/cancelPassengerRequest: This endpoint creates requests, doesn't cancel them
 * - This endpoint is specifically for request creation (batch support)
 * - Other endpoints handle request actions (accept, cancel, verify status)
 *
 * Transaction Coverage:
 * - ✅ Admin user creation: Fully wrapped in transaction (FIXED)
 *   - createUser function now accepts connection parameter for transaction support
 *   - Admin user creation happens INSIDE the same transaction as request creation
 *   - All operations (user creation, batch check, request creation) are atomic
 *   - ✅ FIXED: No more orphaned users - if request creation fails, user creation is rolled back
 *   - ✅ FIXED: Full transaction support - all succeed or all fail together
 *   - Impact: High (prevents data inconsistency - was a critical issue)
 *
 * - ✅ Batch check + request creation: Fully wrapped in transaction
 *   - Batch check (SELECT) uses transaction connection (consistent snapshot)
 *   - All request creations (INSERT) use transaction connection
 *   - All operations atomic (30 second timeout - includes admin user creation if needed)
 *   - Either all requests created or none created (prevents partial creation)
 *   - Automatic rollback on any failure
 *   - Prevents race condition: Multiple concurrent requests are serialized
 *   - Database isolation ensures consistent snapshot during transaction
 *
 * - ✅ Vehicle type validation: INSIDE transaction (FIXED - uses transaction connection)

 *
 * Race Condition Prevention:
 * - ✅ Batch check and request creation are atomic (same transaction)

 *   - First request acquires lock, passes batch check, creates requests
 *   - Subsequent requests see updated count (due to transaction isolation)
 *   - Prevents exceeding numberOfVehicles limit even with concurrent requests
 *   - Database isolation level ensures consistent snapshot during transaction
 *
 * Known Limitations & Logical Issues:
 * 1. ✅ FIXED: Admin user creation now uses same transaction (createUser now accepts connection parameter)
 *    - ✅ FIXED: User creation and request creation are atomic (all succeed or all fail)
 *    - ✅ FIXED: No more orphaned users - if request creation fails, user creation is rolled back
 *    - Impact: High (was a critical issue - now resolved)
 *    - Status: Fixed - full transaction support implemented
 *
 * 2. ✅ FIXED: Vehicle type validation now happens inside transaction
 *    - ✅ FIXED: Validation uses transaction connection for consistent snapshot
 *    - ✅ FIXED: Prevents race condition - if vehicle type is deleted, validation sees consistent state
 *    - ✅ FIXED: If validation fails, transaction is rolled back (atomic)
 *    - Impact: Low (was a minor issue - now resolved)
 *    - Status: Fixed - vehicle type validation now uses transaction connection
 *
 * 3. ✅ Batch check uses transaction connection (race condition prevented)
 *    - Status: Fixed - batch check uses connection for consistent snapshot
 *    - Prevents time-of-check-time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition
 *
 * 4. ✅ Sequential creation ensures batch ordering
 *    - Status: Correct - sequential creation is safer than parallel for batch ordering
 *    - Could be optimized to parallel creation with proper error handling
 *
 * Potential Improvements:
 * 1. ✅ COMPLETED: Modified createUser to accept connection parameter for full transaction support
 *    - ✅ Admin user creation is now part of request creation transaction
 *    - ✅ Eliminated orphaned user edge case (all operations atomic)
 *    - ✅ createUser function now supports connection parameter
 *
 * 2. Move vehicle type validation inside transaction
 *    - Would ensure vehicle type exists at time of insert
 *    - Prevents edge case where validation passes but type deleted before insert
 *    - Minor performance impact (validation inside transaction)
 *
 * 3. Optimize sequential creation to parallel creation
 *    - Could use Promise.all for parallel creation
 *    - Would improve performance for multiple requests
 *    - Requires proper error handling for partial failures
 *    - Current sequential approach is safer
 *
 * 4. Add composite index on (passengerRequestBatchId, userUniqueId)
 *    - Would improve batch check query performance
 *    - Recommended for high-frequency batch checks
 *
 * 5. Cache vehicle type validation
 *    - Validate once before loop, reuse result
 *    - Would eliminate redundant database queries
 *    - Minor optimization for multiple request creation
