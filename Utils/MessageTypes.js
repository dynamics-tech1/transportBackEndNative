/*

This JavaScript code defines an object called 

messageTypes

 that contains various message types related to passenger and driver requests. Each message type is represented as a key-value pair, where the key is the message type identifier and the value is an object containing a 

message

 and 

details

 (which appears to be a typo for "details"). The 

message

 provides a brief description of the action, while 

details

 gives a more detailed explanation of the circumstances under which the message is used. Finally, the 

messageTypes

 object is exported using 

module.exports

 for use in other parts of the application.

Here's a corrected version of the code with the typos fixed:
